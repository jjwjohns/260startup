# PlayMancala

[My Notes](notes.md)

My startup application is to create an online game site for mancala. Clients will be able to login and challenge other players to a game of mancala. They will be able to create games or join existing games and then play through a game of mancala taking turns until the game is over.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will have 3 correctly structured html pages. One for logging in, one for playing, and one for reading about Mancala. I will have a navigation bar that persists on each page with links to the three pages.
- **CSS** - Appropriate styling of pages. Will design a basic mancala board.
- **React** - Achieve all desired functionality for buttons. This includes loging in, joining games, creating games, and turnstyle gameplay.
- **Service** - Will use an outside service to provide quotes on my about page.
- **DB/Login** - Will have a table to store login information. Will also have a table to store games.
- **WebSocket** - Realtime user to user data transfer for gameplay.

## ðŸš€ CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] **Header, footer, and main content body** - I stylized all three content sections and implemented flex box into them as well.
- [X] **Navigation elements** - I dropped the underline and spaced and stylized them. I also made it so they highlight when the mouse hovers over them.
- [X] **Responsive to window resizing** - I made my application responsive to window resizing and my nav elements go into a dropdown window on smaller sizes.
- [X] **Application elements** - Everything is spaced out well and the application looks clean. Basic CSS Mancala board is now made.
- [X] **Application text content** - Consistent fonts and colorings.

## ðŸš€ React part 1: Routing deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] **Bundled using Vite** - I downloaded vite and used it to bundle my application and run it in build dev mode.
- [X] **Components** - I have three react components that is connected to the router to import my main section. They are login, play, and about. They all work as they should.
- [X] **Router** - I added the router in app.jsx which correctly routes to the different components.

## ðŸš€ React part 2: Reactivity

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] **All functionality implemented or mocked out** - I fully implemented the mancala gameplay. Set with turns end game evaluation and special rules. I also set everything up to render based on what state you are in authorized/logged in and in a game or night. I also implemented a dynamic table where you can create games and then join them. This will be a little different moving forward because when you create a game you will automatically join it and joining is used to join other people's games. I also implemented a basic bot for the user to play against for this deliverable.
- [X] **Hooks** - I used useState and useEffect to be able to store all of the variable and states.

## ðŸš€ Service deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] **Node.js/Express HTTP service** - I fully implemented a node.js/express http service. My front end is served up through express and calls backend service api endpoints to implement the functionality of the application. Fully functional authentication service (minus DB).
- [X] **Static middleware for frontend** - I used express to serve up the files in the public folder.
- [X] **Calls to third party endpoints** - I implemented a quote service that generates quotes on my about page.
- [X] **Backend service endpoints** - I implemented the following backend service endpoints: createAuth(/auth/create)(post), GetAuth(/auth/login)(get), DeleteAuth(/auth/logout)(delete), GetGames (/game/:id)(get), JoinGame(/game/:id/join)(post), DeleteGame(/game/:id)(delete), and createGame(/game)(post). Most of these endpoints are restricted and requires to pass through the verifyAuth middleware.
- [X] **Frontend calls service endpoints** - I called the following endpoints from my frontend: CreateAuth, GetAuth, DeleteAuth, DeleteGame, CreateGame. My frontend now stores data in local storage and sends data to store in the backend service. 

## ðŸš€ DB/Login deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] **User registration** - Users can register and have their data stored in my Mongo Database. This data persists and they can login after they end the current instance.
- [X] **User login and logout** - My login and logout is now fully functional with the data being stored in a database. Logout deletes the auth token from cookies and they get a new one when they log back in. This auth token is then stored back in the DB
- [X] **Stores data in MongoDB** - I am storing my list of games in MongoDB to have it persist and be available for others to join. I also left the list of games in local storage for easier UI rendering.
- [X] **Stores credentials in MongoDB** - MongoDB stores all of my user info and persists when a user leaves. Passwords are hashed.
- [X] **Restricts functionality based on authentication** - My endpoints are still restricted by the verifyAuth middleware. All of my database calls are behind endpoints so a valid auth token is required for most functionality.

## ðŸš€ WebSocket deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] **Backend listens for WebSocket connection** - I created a backend listener and proxy for websockets. It organizes communications into games and then only communicates messages between games. It sends moves, joins, disconnects, and errors.
- [X] **Frontend makes WebSocket connection** - Front end sends websocket communications for every move it makes and when it joins or leaves a game.
- [X] **Data sent over WebSocket connection** - Data is sent back and forth between two clients when they are in the same game.
- [X] **WebSocket data displayed** - When a client joins or leaves a game the paired client is notified. When a client makes a move it sends that move over to the paired client where it is displayed on their mancala board. These communications are blocked when it is not their turn or when only one client is in a game.
- [X] **Application is fully functional** - Yep! You can now play Mancala online with your friends!
