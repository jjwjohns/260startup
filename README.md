### Technologies

- **CSS** - Appropriate styling of pages. Will design a basic mancala board.
- **React** - Achieve all desired functionality for buttons. This includes loging in, joining games, creating games, and turnstyle gameplay.
- **Service** - Will use an outside service to provide quotes on my about page.
- **DB/Login** - Will have a table to store login information. Will also have a table to store games.
