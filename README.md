# PlayMancala

[My Notes](notes.md)

My startup application is to create an online game site for mancala. Clients will be able to login and challenge other players to a game of mancala. They will be able to create games or join existing games and then play through a game of mancala taking turns until the game is over.

### Technologies

- **CSS** - Appropriate styling of pages. Will design a basic mancala board.
- **React** - Achieve all desired functionality for buttons. This includes loging in, joining games, creating games, and turnstyle gameplay.

- **DB/Login** - Will have a table to store login information. Will also have a table to store games.
